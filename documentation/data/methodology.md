- **Climate Reanalysis Products**: ERA5, MERRA-2, and other reanalysis datasets
- **National Meteorological Agencies**: Data from African national weather services
- **Research Institutions**: Data from academic and research organizations
- **International Organizations**: World Bank, UN agencies, and other international bodies

### Collection Methods

Data is collected through various methods:

- **Direct API Integration**: Automated data retrieval from source APIs
- **Periodic Bulk Downloads**: Scheduled downloads of updated datasets
- **Manual Curation**: Expert review and selection of high-quality datasets
- **Collaborative Submissions**: Vetted contributions from research partners

### Temporal and Spatial Coverage

- **Temporal Range**: Most datasets cover the period from 1950 to present, with some historical records extending back to the late 19th century
- **Spatial Resolution**: Varies by dataset, ranging from point-based weather station data to gridded data at resolutions from 0.25° to 1.0° (approximately 25km to 100km at the equator)
- **Geographic Coverage**: All 54 African countries, with varying density of observations

## Data Cleaning and Validation

### Quality Control Procedures

All datasets undergo rigorous quality control:

### Missing Data Handling

Missing data is addressed through several approaches:

- **Flagging**: Transparent indication of missing data in visualizations
- **Interpolation**: For short gaps, using appropriate statistical methods:
  - Linear interpolation for short gaps (<3 data points)
  - Spline interpolation for moderate gaps with smooth transitions
  - Pattern-based methods for seasonal data
- **Multiple Imputation**: For systematic analysis requiring complete datasets
- **Exclusion**: Omitting periods with insufficient data coverage when necessary

### Data Corrections

When corrections are applied:

- Original and corrected values are preserved
- Correction methods are documented
- Uncertainty introduced by corrections is quantified where possible
- Users are notified of significant corrections through metadata

## Data Harmonization

### Standardization Procedures

To enable comparison across different datasets:

- **Common Units**: Conversion to standard units (e.g., temperature in °C, precipitation in mm)
- **Temporal Alignment**: Resampling to common time steps (daily, monthly, annual)
- **Spatial Harmonization**: Regridding to common spatial resolutions
- **Reference Periods**: Standardization to common baseline periods (typically 1961-1990 or 1981-2010)

### Cross-Dataset Calibration

When integrating multiple data sources:

- **Bias Correction**: Adjustment for systematic differences between datasets
- **Ensemble Approaches**: Combining multiple datasets with appropriate weighting
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: Tracking how uncertainty changes through processing steps

### Metadata Standardization
